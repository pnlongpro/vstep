    sampleAnswer: `Dear Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to write and tell you all about my new life here in Melbourne.

The city is absolutely amazing – it's so vibrant and multicultural. My workplace is in the city center, and I love the modern office and friendly colleagues. Everyone has been so welcoming, which has made the transition much easier.

I'm settling in really well. I've found a nice apartment near the beach, and I've already discovered some great cafes and restaurants nearby. The weather is beautiful, and I've been exploring the city every weekend.

I would love for you to come visit! There's a spare bedroom in my apartment, and I'd be thrilled to show you around. Let me know when you might be free – maybe next month?

I miss you and can't wait to catch up properly!

Love,
Emma`,

    title: 'Opinion Essay: Remote Work',
    prompt: 'Many companies now allow their employees to work from home instead of coming to the office every day.\n\nDo you think the advantages of working from home outweigh the disadvantages?\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nWrite at least 250 words.',

    ],
    sampleAnswer: `The trend of remote work has gained significant momentum in recent years, particularly accelerated by the global pandemic. While this working arrangement presents certain challenges, I believe the advantages substantially outweigh the disadvantages.

One of the primary benefits of working from home is the improved work-life balance it offers. Employees can save considerable time and money by eliminating daily commutes, which often take several hours in major cities. This extra time can be invested in family, hobbies, or rest, leading to better mental health and job satisfaction. Additionally, remote work provides greater flexibility, allowing people to manage their schedules more effectively and attend to personal matters when necessary.

Furthermore, working from home can boost productivity for many individuals. Without the distractions of a busy office environment, such as impromptu meetings or colleague conversations, employees can focus more intensely on their tasks. Many workers also report feeling more comfortable and relaxed in their home environment, which can enhance creativity and efficiency.

However, it is important to acknowledge the potential downsides. Some people may feel isolated and miss the social interaction that comes with office life. There can also be challenges in separating work from personal life when both occur in the same space. Nevertheless, these issues can be mitigated through regular virtual team meetings and establishing clear boundaries between work and personal time.

In conclusion, while remote work is not without its challenges, the benefits of increased flexibility, improved work-life balance, and potential productivity gains make it a valuable option for modern workers. Companies should continue to embrace this trend while providing support to help employees manage its challenges effectively.`,

    title: 'Argumentative Essay: Artificial Intelligence',
    prompt: 'Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used in various sectors, from healthcare to finance. Some people believe that AI will greatly benefit society, while others worry about its potential risks.\n\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nProvide reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.\n\nWrite at least 280 words.',

    ],
    sampleAnswer: `The advent of artificial intelligence has sparked considerable debate regarding its implications for modern society. While proponents highlight its transformative potential across various sectors, critics raise legitimate concerns about the risks it poses. This essay will examine both perspectives before presenting my own viewpoint.

Advocates of AI emphasize its capacity to revolutionize industries and improve quality of life. In healthcare, for instance, AI algorithms can analyze medical images with remarkable accuracy, potentially detecting diseases earlier than human physicians. Similarly, in finance, AI-powered systems can identify fraudulent transactions in real-time, protecting consumers and institutions alike. Moreover, AI has the potential to address pressing global challenges, such as climate change, by optimizing energy consumption and developing sustainable solutions that would be impossible to achieve through human effort alone.

Conversely, skeptics highlight several concerning aspects of AI development. The displacement of human workers represents a significant worry, as automation threatens to render numerous professions obsolete. This could exacerbate social inequality and create unprecedented unemployment challenges. Additionally, the ethical implications of AI decision-making, particularly in sensitive areas such as criminal justice or military applications, raise troubling questions about accountability and human autonomy. There are also valid concerns about data privacy and the potential for AI systems to perpetuate or amplify existing societal biases.

In my opinion, while the risks associated with AI are substantial and merit serious consideration, the potential benefits are too significant to ignore. The key lies not in resisting AI development, but rather in implementing robust regulatory frameworks and ethical guidelines to govern its application. By fostering responsible innovation that prioritizes human welfare and maintains appropriate oversight, we can harness AI's transformative power while mitigating its dangers.

In conclusion, artificial intelligence presents both remarkable opportunities and genuine challenges for society. A balanced approach that embraces innovation while maintaining vigilant oversight represents the most prudent path forward.`,

    title: 'Opinion Essay: Learning English',

      'Give 2-3 reasons',
      'Use simple connecting words',
      'Write a short conclusion',
    ],
    sampleAnswer: `Learning English is important in today's world, and there are different opinions about the best way to do it. I believe that while studying in an English-speaking country has benefits, it is not necessary to learn the language effectively.

Studying abroad can help students improve their English quickly because they are surrounded by the language every day. They can practice speaking with native speakers and learn about the culture at the same time. However, this option is very expensive and not possible for everyone.

On the other hand, students can learn English successfully in their own country. With modern technology, there are many online resources, apps, and courses available. Students can watch English movies, listen to podcasts, and join online conversation groups. These methods are more affordable and flexible.

In conclusion, although studying in an English-speaking country can be helpful, I think it is possible to learn English well in your own country if you are motivated and use good resources. The most important factor is regular practice and dedication, not the location.`,

      'Describe main trends and patterns',

    ],
    sampleAnswer: `The bar chart illustrates the proportion of adults who participated in various sports activities in a European nation during 2020.

Overall, it is evident that walking was by far the most popular physical activity, while team sports attracted the least participation. The data reveals a clear preference for individual activities over team-based sports.

Walking dominated the chart with 45% of adults participating regularly, making it nearly twice as popular as the second-ranked activity. Swimming followed with 25% participation, while cycling attracted 20% of adults. These three activities constituted the majority of sporting engagement among the population.

In contrast, gym-based activities showed moderate popularity at 18%, slightly higher than running at 15%. Team sports, including football, basketball, and volleyball, collectively represented only 12% of adult participation, making them the least favored category.

The data suggests that adults in this country prefer accessible, low-commitment activities that can be done individually. The relatively low participation in team sports may reflect scheduling challenges and the greater coordination required for such activities. This information could be valuable for public health initiatives aiming to increase physical activity levels in the population.`,
