    title: 'Climate Change and Its Effects',

    part: 1,
    passage: `Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. Over the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius. This warming is primarily caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas.

The effects of climate change are far-reaching and devastating. Rising temperatures are causing polar ice caps to melt, leading to rising sea levels that threaten coastal communities worldwide. More frequent and severe weather events, including hurricanes, droughts, and floods, are becoming the new normal. These changes are not only affecting our environment but also our economy, health, and way of life.

Scientists warn that if we don't take immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the consequences could be catastrophic. Many countries have committed to reducing their carbon footprint through renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. However, individual actions also matter. Simple steps like reducing energy consumption, using public transportation, and supporting sustainable businesses can make a significant difference.

The good news is that it's not too late to make a change. By working together globally and taking responsibility for our actions, we can help mitigate the worst effects of climate change and create a more sustainable future for generations to come.`,

    title: 'The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence',
    description: 'Đọc hiểu về sự phát triển của trí tuệ nhân tạo',
    duration: 18,
    passage: `Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undergone a remarkable transformation since its inception in the mid-20th century. What began as a theoretical concept has evolved into a technology that permeates nearly every aspect of modern life, from smartphone assistants to autonomous vehicles and advanced medical diagnostics.

The journey of AI can be broadly divided into several phases. The early years, from the 1950s to the 1970s, were characterized by optimism and grand predictions. Researchers believed that human-level AI was just around the corner. However, the limitations of computing power and the complexity of human cognition soon became apparent, leading to what is known as the "AI winter" – a period of reduced funding and interest.

The resurgence of AI in the 21st century has been driven by three key factors: exponential growth in computing power, the availability of massive datasets, and breakthroughs in machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning. These advances have enabled AI systems to achieve superhuman performance in specific tasks, such as image recognition, language translation, and game playing.

However, the rise of AI also presents significant challenges. Ethical concerns about bias in AI systems, job displacement due to automation, and questions about AI governance and control are hotly debated topics. Moreover, the concept of "artificial general intelligence" – AI that can match human cognitive abilities across all domains – remains elusive and controversial.

Looking ahead, the future of AI is likely to be shaped by how we address these challenges while continuing to harness its potential benefits. The key lies in developing AI that is not only powerful but also transparent, accountable, and aligned with human values.`,

    passage: `Last Sunday, my family and I went to the city park. It was a beautiful sunny day, perfect for outdoor activities. We arrived at the park around 9 o'clock in the morning.

The park was full of people enjoying their weekend. Some people were jogging, others were walking their dogs, and children were playing on the playground. There were also many families having picnics on the grass.

My little brother wanted to play on the swings first. After that, we played frisbee together for about an hour. My mother brought sandwiches and fruit for lunch. We sat under a big tree and enjoyed our meal while watching the ducks swimming in the pond.

In the afternoon, we rented bicycles and rode around the park. The weather was perfect – not too hot and not too cold. We stayed at the park until 5 o'clock and then went home. Everyone was tired but happy. It was a wonderful day!`,

    title: 'The Implications of Quantum Computing',
    description: 'Đọc hiểu về tác động của máy tính lượng tử',
    duration: 20,
    passage: `Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational technology, promising to revolutionize fields ranging from cryptography to drug discovery. Unlike classical computers, which process information in binary bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers leverage quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform calculations using quantum bits, or qubits.

The potential of quantum computing lies in its ability to solve certain classes of problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Shor's algorithm, when run on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, could factor large numbers efficiently – a capability that would render current encryption methods obsolete. Similarly, quantum computers could simulate molecular interactions with unprecedented accuracy, accelerating the development of new pharmaceuticals and materials.

However, the path to practical quantum computing is fraught with formidable challenges. Qubits are extraordinarily fragile, susceptible to decoherence caused by environmental interference. Maintaining quantum coherence requires operating at temperatures approaching absolute zero and implementing sophisticated error correction mechanisms. Current quantum computers, while demonstrating "quantum supremacy" in specific benchmarks, remain too unstable and limited for most practical applications.

The implications of quantum computing extend far beyond technical considerations. The technology poses existential threats to current cybersecurity infrastructure, potentially enabling the decryption of sensitive data retroactively. This has spurred the development of "post-quantum cryptography" – encryption methods designed to resist quantum attacks. Moreover, the immense resources required for quantum computing research raise questions about equitable access and the potential for technological hegemony.

As we stand on the precipice of the quantum era, the scientific community faces the dual challenge of advancing the technology while simultaneously preparing society for its ramifications. The trajectory of quantum computing will likely be determined not solely by technical breakthroughs, but by how we navigate the complex ethical, security, and societal dimensions of this transformative technology.`,
